# Earthquake Detection and Alert System

## Overview

The **Earthquake Detection and Alert System** detects P-waves (Primary waves) before the arrival of S-waves (Secondary waves) from an earthquake. This early detection allows for timely alerts to people and can also be integrated with building dampers to reduce earthquake impact.

## Project Structure

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **README.md**: This file.
- **backend/**: Contains server-side code.
- **nano.txt**: Details for working with Nano sensors.
- **nodemcu.txt**: Details for working with NodeMCU.
- **package-lock.json**: Lock file for Node.js dependencies.
- **package.json**: Node.js project dependencies and scripts.
- **public/**: Static files like HTML, CSS.
- **src/**: Source code for the application.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Hardware**:
  - **Adxl 355**: Configure as described in `nano.txt`.
  - **NodeMCU**: Follow instructions in `nodemcu.txt` for integration.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PragatiBasnet29/earthquake_and-_alter_system.git
   cd earthquake_and-_alter_system`

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**:

   Configure any environment variables or settings required by your application. This might involve setting up a `.env` file or similar configuration files.

4. **Run the Application**:

   Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start your Node.js server. Check the `scripts` section in `package.json` for any additional commands if required.

### Frontend

The static files are located in the `public/` directory. If you need to build or process frontend assets, refer to `tailwind.config.js` for the Tailwind CSS setup.

## Usage

- **Monitor Alerts**: The application provides real-time notifications for earthquake detection. Ensure that the hardware components (sensors, NodeMCU) are correctly configured and connected.
- **Integration with Building Dampers**: The system can be integrated with building dampers to reduce the impact of earthquakes on structures.

## Hardware Setup

- **Nano Sensors**: Refer to `nano.txt` for detailed instructions on setting up and configuring the Nano sensors used in this project.
- **NodeMCU Integration**: Follow the instructions in `nodemcu.txt` for integrating the NodeMCU with your system to facilitate the earthquake detection mechanism.
